# VM-Load-Balancing-Algorithm
Two new VM Load balancing algorithms have been implemented in CloudSim using heap sort where VMs are heap sorted on the basis of amount for which a VM is busy in the first algorithm.And in the second algorithm First VMs are sorted on the basis of MIPS i.e VM having highest VM getting the cloudlet.This process continues till the number of cloudlets is less than or equal to number of VMs.After that VMs are heap sorted on the basis of busy time .VM at the top of the heap gets the next cloudlet.This time is calculated by using the formnula(length/MIPS) where length is the cloudlet length and MIPS is the VM capability to execute instructions per second.VM having the lowest busy time gets the cloudlet.
