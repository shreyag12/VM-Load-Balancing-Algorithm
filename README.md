# VM-Load-Balancing-Algorithm
A new VM Load balancing algorithm has been implemented in CloudSim using heap sort where VMs are heap sorted on the basis of amount for which a VM is busy.This time is calculated by using the formnula(length/MIPS) where length is the cloudlet length and MIPS is the VM capability to execute instructions per second.
